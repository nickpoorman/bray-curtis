# bray-curtis

Nearest neighbor using bray curtis dissimilarity.

[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/f0435d8b2ad48a6efb7c5e094c31d641/s "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/f0435d8b2ad48a6efb7c5e094c31d641)

This is a Bray Curtis implementation for nearest neighbor. More information can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray%E2%80%93Curtis_dissimilarity).

*"The Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity is bound between 0 and 1, where 0 means the two sites have the same composition (that is they share all the species), and 1 means the two sites do not share any species."*

**Note**: This implementation actually uses the **Bray-Curtis index**. This means the values are bound between 0 and 100, and 0 means the two sites do not share any species. This is implemented like so:

```javascript
dissimilarity = dissimilarity * 100; // interpret dissimilarity as a percentage
var similarity = 100 - dissimilarity; // change dissimilarity to similarity (Bray-Curtis index)
```

# methods
```javascript
var BrayCurtis = require('bray-curtis');
```

## var nn = BrayCurtis(vectors)

Create a new Bray Curtis nearest neighbor instance. `vector` is an array (neighbors) of arrays (neighbor features).

### var neighbors = nn.knn(subject, k);

Returns the `k` most nearest neighbors to `subject` (the target neighbor). `k` default is `10`.

Resulting `neighbors` is a sorted, (most similar first) array where each object has the following properties:
  * `vector` - the neighbor vector
  * `d` - the "Bray-Curtis index" score. ie. similarity score.

# example

```javascript
var BrayCurtis = require('bray-curtis');
var vectors = [
  [26, 4, 13, 11, 0],
  [0, 10, 9, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 15, 3, 0],
  [13, 5, 3, 10, 7],
  [31, 21, 13, 16, 5],
  [9, 6, 0, 11, 2],
  [32, 26, 0, 23, 0],
  [32, 21, 0, 10, 2],
  [24, 17, 0, 25, 6],
  [16, 3, 12, 20, 2],
  [11, 0, 7, 8, 0],
  [24, 37, 5, 18, 1]
  ];
var nn = new BrayCurtis(vectors);

var subject = [32, 26, 0, 23, 0];
var mostSimilar = [32, 21, 0, 10, 2];

var neighbors = nn.knn(subject, 2);
var neighbor = neighbors[1]; // the subject itself should always be returned as the first element because the item will be most similar to itself, so we get the second element
neighbors[0].d.should.eql(100);
neighbor.vector.should.eql(mostSimilar);
```
